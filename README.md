# Admin UI

## Part of the HireQuotient Assessment

The Admin UI Panel is made using React. 

## Features

1. Column titles stand out from the entries.
2. There is a search bar that can filter on any property (ID, Name, Email, Role).
3. You should be able to edit or delete rows in place. (Edit and delete are expected to only happen in memory.)
4. Implemented pagination: Each page contains 10 rows. Buttons at the bottom allow you to jump to any page including special buttons for the first page, previous page, next page and last page. Pagination must be updated based on search/filtering. If 25 records for example match a search query, then pagination buttons should only go to 3.
5. You should be able to select one or more rows. A selected row is highlighted with a grayish background color. Multiple selected rows can be deleted at once using the 'Delete Selected' button at the top right bin icon.
6. The checkbox on the top left is a shortcut to select or deselect all displayed rows. This should only apply to the ten rows displayed on the current page, and not all 50 rows.
7. Searching triggers on search query changes and triggers a search on ENTER.
8. On clicking the edit action in a row, it should be editable in the row itself.
